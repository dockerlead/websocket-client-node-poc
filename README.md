# Websocket Client POC
You can test your websocket server anytime easily just by hitting `npm start`.  
This client will print all data received from your server asap, you can also add some data sending logic to it.  
Put your websocket endpoint into your .env file like so:  
```bash
cp env.example .env
npm i
npm start
```
Boom!
